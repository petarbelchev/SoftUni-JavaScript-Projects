# JS Advanced

In the "JS Advanced" course, we get a deep knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. We studied more complex concepts like function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course develop ours algorithmic thinking. After successful completion of this course, we be able to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming was explored, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chaining.
